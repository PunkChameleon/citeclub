Paris has been building its transportation system throughout history and continuous improvements are on-going. The Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF), formerly ''Syndicat des transports parisiens'' (STP) oversees the transit network in the region.<ref name="stif">{{cite web|url=http://www.stif-idf.fr|title=Le web des voyageurs franciliens|author=Syndicat des Transports d'Île-de-France (STIF)|accessdate=2006-04-10|language=French}}</ref>

The members of this syndicate are the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France region]] and the eight departments of this region. The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the [[Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens|RATP]] (operating 654 [[Bus (RATP)|bus]] lines, the [[Paris Métro|Métro]], three [[Tramways in Île-de-France|tramway]] lines, and sections of the [[RER]]), the [[SNCF]] (operating [[Transilien|suburban rails]], one [[Tramways in Île-de-France|tramway]] line and the other sections of the RER) and the [[Optile]] consortium of private operators managing 1,070 minor bus lines.
